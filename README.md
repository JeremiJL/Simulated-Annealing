# Implementation of Simulated Annealing

The purpose of this local search algorithm implementation is to 
solve the traveling salesman optimization (TSP) problem.

Algorithm accepts three hyperparameters :
- the maximum number of idle iterations i.e. iterations during which the currently evaluated sequence has not changed
- initial temperature from which the algorithm starts
- the rate of temperature decrease
